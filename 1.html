    <H1>What is GITHUB </H1>
    <P>Git is a specific open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.<br>


        Specifically, Git is a distributed version control system,<br>
        which means that the entire codebase and history is
        available on every developerâ€™s computer,<br>
         which allows for easy branching and merging.

        According to a Stack Overflow developer survey, <br>
        over 87% of developers use Git.</P>
